# ics-cybersleuth-ai
A machine learning project focused on detecting cyber incidents within critical industrial systems using data from various real-world and simulated datasets. This repository includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training to distinguish between normal operations and potential cyber threats in industrial control systems (ICS). The datasets used in this project include contributions from iTrust, Centre for Research in Cyber Security, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), specifically the BATtle of Attack Detection Algorithms (BATADAL) dataset. This dataset was part of a competition aimed at benchmarking algorithms for detecting cyber attacks on water distribution systems. For further details on the datasets, visit iTrust Labs Datasets (https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/).
